## Description
This is a repository of my professional portfolio. Inside the deployed application, you will find a responsive and accessible webpage. You will also see my artistic design in action through color schemes, typography, personalized logos, a recent photo of myself and images that link you to my projects.

Creating this webpage has not been easy, but it has been so beneficial in helping me discover what I can do and if I don't know how to do something, I can effectively research and problem solve to accomplish a goal and vision.
